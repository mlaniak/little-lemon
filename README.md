# Little Lemon - Reserve a Table Feature 🍋

Hey there! I'm Michael Laniak, and I created this as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course. This project marks a milestone in my UX/UI journey, and it's all about bringing convenience and style to the **Little Lemon** restaurant's website.

## 🌟 What's This All About?

Little Lemon needed an online booking feature, so I rolled up my sleeves and built one! This project is the culmination of everything I learned in the course, from user research to high-fidelity prototypes. While the entire restaurant website is included, the booking system is the star of the show - designed with mobile users in mind and showcasing a seamless reservation experience.

> **Note**: The **Reserve a Table** function is the primary focus, demonstrating my skills in React development and UX design principles.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Booking System**: Pick your preferred date, time, and party size with our dynamic reservation system
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for the way people actually make reservations - on their phones!
- **Accessibility First**: Built following WCAG guidelines, because good design is for everyone
- **Clean, Modern UI**: A beautiful interface that makes booking a table a pleasure
- **API Integration**: Set up with mock API integration, ready for real-world implementation
